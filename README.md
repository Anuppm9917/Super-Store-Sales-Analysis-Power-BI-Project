# Super-Store-Sales-Analysis-Power-BI-Project

# Overview
In pursue of knowledge and understanding of which products, regions, categories and customer segments a company should target or avoid, I search and selected an appropriate dataset on kaggle which will match a standard superstore requirement. With growing demands and cut-throat competitions in the market, companies are seeking ideas on how to optimize profits. The project is carried out in the following steps. 

# Libraries
numpy for mathematical operations on arrays.
datetime for date manipulation.
pandas to perform data manipulation and analysis.
seaborn for data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
plotly to create beautiful interactive web-based visualizations.
plotly express easy-to-use, high-level interface to Plotly.

# Languages and Tools
Python 3.11.0	Programming Language For data cleaning, manipulation and visualization Tools

# Tools & Environment	Usage
Jupyter NoteBook	An open-source IDE used to create the Jupyter document.
Power BI (Power Query, DAX)	Data visualization tool.
Kaggle	For downloading training data.
Git	A version control system to manage and keep track source code history.
